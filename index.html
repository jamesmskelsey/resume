              Utilize concepts of just-in-time Lean management to lead 75 Sailors and Marines in the completion of 4,687
              maintenance actions in support of pre-deployment work ups that led to the successful deployment of the USS
              Essex across three fleet areas of responsibility.

            <p>
              Manage team of 50 personnel to track and complete upkeep on 2,500 maintenance items. Implement an
              aggressive training regimen to restore maintenance program from failed to passing with a perfect score
              utilizing proven Lean process improvement philosophy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Develop a website and database to handle the creation of "brag sheets" for Sailors using Ruby on Rails,
              JavaScript,
              and PostgreSQL that had over 3,500 users at it's peak. Users were able to track accomplishments and
              receive
              automatic assistance in preparing their yearly review; was considered for incorporation as an official US

              website.
            </p>
            <p>
              Develop stand alone user interface with Vue.js and CSS to process data from a large database to
              automatically
              detect thousands of errors with Regular Expressions, saving hundreds of man-hours of manual work.
              Design a secure, web enabled database in the cloud using Ruby on Rails to track, perform trend analysis,
              and
              chart discrepancies that were found during audits and drills leading up to a major inspection at Fleet
              Readiness
              Center Northwest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maintain working knowledge and quickly adapt to new frameworks such as React, Vue, Svelte,Bootstrap, and
              Tailwind. Some experience with NodeJS. Write custom SQL queries to retrieve data from the maintenance data
              system for analysis.

              This Vue.js/Firebase single page application was developed to make up for the deficiencies of existing
              Navy software. Accepts data from a maintenance data system, processes it, stores it in a database, and
              presents
              it to the user cleanly with errors highlighted automatically.
